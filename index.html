                    <p>My name is Alexis Long (left), but I have gone by Lexi for as long as I can remember. 
                        I am 23 years old with two younger sisters, Miranda (22, middle) and Paige (20, right). 
                        We have a 15-year old, 16 pound cat named Simon, and two 9-year old boxer-golden retriever mixes, Halo (right) and Roxy (left). 
                        I miss them all very much when I am in Eau Claire for school, as my hometown is Whitewater, WI (about 3 1/2 hours away). 
                        I will hopefully be graduating from UWEC this May with a double-major in Accounting and Information Systems and a certificate in Advanced Business Communications.

                    <p>When it comes to work I am (almost) always motivated to do my very best. 
                        My first job was at Culvers where I became a manager after about a year and a half of work. 
                        I started working there when I was a junior in high school and, though I'm at a different location now, I still go back to work there during breaks. 
                        I believe that working at Culvers has provided me with many of the necessary skills to successfully progress in my future career. 
                        Professionally, I have one tax internship under my belt, and I do plan on going into tax accounting after graduation.

                <div>
                    <p>Since my professional work experience consists of a tax internship (where you can imagine I completed tax returns), I don't have many imanges that express the work that I have done or am able to do. 
                        That being said, I think the best way to show my collection of accounting work is to list everything that I am able to do.<br>
                        My accounting skills include:
                    </p>

                        <li>Completing Individual Tax Returns</li>
